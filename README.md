# GrooveyFM
## Unfinished rewrite in C# #

GrooveyFM was a PHP application I made in 2011-2013 to sync radio station playlists with Grooveshark. Scraped playlists from radio stations ([example playlist](http://www.mediabase.com/whatsong/whatsong.asp?var_s=087082087068045070077)). 

Alas, [Grooveshark closed in May 2015](http://www.inquisitr.com/2056893/grooveshark-forced-to-close-due-to-courts-ruling/).

This is an unfinished rewrite from 2013 in C# using EntityFramework, with most of the code focused on scraping and processing playlists and storing them. For the old PHP version, see [T3hUb3rK1tten/GrooveyFM-PHP](https://github.com/T3hUb3rK1tten/GrooveyFM-PHP).
